# Hi there! I’m Mohanish Gupta 

I hold a B.Tech degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE), and I have transitioned into the role of a Data Analyst. My passion lies in transforming complex datasets into actionable insights that drive smarter decisions.

I specialize in Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Python, with a strong focus on data visualization and analysis. I enjoy diving deep into data to uncover trends and patterns that make a difference.

I’m constantly learning and evolving in this field, always looking for new challenges to enhance my skills and contribute meaningfully to data-driven solutions.
